        "question": "What are Chain-Fox Platform Credits?",
        "answer": "The Chain-Fox Credits System is designed to reward community participation and provide access to various platform features. It explains how the credits system works, how to earn credits, and how to use them within the Chain-Fox ecosystem.\n\nChain-Fox Credits are a derivative of CFX tokens, obtained through holding or staking CFX. They represent your ability to access premium features and will play a significant role in the future governance of the Chain-Fox ecosystem.\n\nKey characteristics of the credits system:\n- Built on a transparent UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, similar to Bitcoin\n- Credits can be transferred between users within the platform\n- Credits represent future DAO governance weight\n- Credits will eventually function as node equity in the future Chain-Fox ecosystem\n- Credits are not financial instruments and have no monetary value"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I earn Credits?",
        "answer": "Credits are primarily derived from holding or staking CFX tokens. There are several ways to earn credits on the Chain-Fox platform:\n\n1. Holding CFX: Users who hold CFX tokens are eligible for credits based on their holdings\n2. Staking CFX: Users who stake CFX tokens receive credits proportional to their stake\n3. Airdrops: Eligible users can receive credits through periodic airdrops\n4. Community Participation: Active participation in the community and ecosystem\n5. Special Events: Participating in special events and promotions\n6. Referrals: Inviting new users to the platform (coming soon)"

      {
        "question": "How is Airdrop Eligibility determined?",
        "answer": "Airdrop eligibility is based on various factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Your wallet activity\n- Token holdings\n- Previous participation in the ecosystem"
      },
      {
        "question": "How are Airdrop Credits calculated?",
        "answer": "For airdrops based on token holdings, we use a tiered system to ensure fair distribution:\n\n0-999 tokens: 50 credits\n1,000-4,999 tokens: 100 credits\n5,000-9,999 tokens: 150 credits\n10,000-49,999 tokens: 200 credits\n50,000-99,999 tokens: 300 credits\n100,000-499,999 tokens: 500 credits\n500,000-999,999 tokens: 750 credits\n1,000,000+ tokens: 1,000 credits\n\nThis tiered approach ensures that even users with small token holdings receive meaningful credits, the difference between the highest and lowest credit awards is reasonable, and the distribution is more balanced than a purely proportional system."

      {
        "question": "How can I use Credits?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Will credits have monetary value in the future?",
        "answer": "No, credits will never have monetary value. They are designed purely as utility points within the Chain-Fox ecosystem, derived from CFX tokens.
